# Namhatta Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for managing Namhatta religious/spiritual organizations. The system provides functionality for managing devotees, Namhattas (spiritual centers), hierarchical leadership structures, and devotional statuses. It's built with modern web technologies and follows a clean architecture pattern.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight router)
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies, bcrypt password hashing
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based sessions with single login enforcement
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (ADMIN, OFFICE, DISTRICT_SUPERVISOR)
- **Security**: Rate limiting, token blacklisting, district-based data filtering
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based session store
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main entities:

1. **Devotees**: Personal information, spiritual status, and courses (addresses stored in normalized tables)
2. **Namhattas**: Spiritual centers with organizational details (addresses stored in normalized tables)
3. **Devotional Statuses**: Hierarchical spiritual levels (Bhakta, Initiated, etc.)
4. **Shraddhakutirs**: Regional spiritual administrative units
5. **Leaders**: Hierarchical leadership structure
6. **Addresses**: Normalized address data (country, state, district, sub_district, village, postal_code)
7. **Devotee_Addresses & Namhatta_Addresses**: Junction tables linking entities to addresses with landmarks
8. **Users**: Authentication users with username, password hash, role, and active status
9. **User_Districts**: Many-to-many mapping between users and districts for access control
10. **User_Sessions**: Single login enforcement with session tokens and expiry
11. **JWT_Blacklist**: Token invalidation for secure logout

### Frontend Components
- **Layout System**: Responsive app layout with navigation
- **Forms**: Comprehensive forms for data entry with validation
- **Data Tables**: Paginated lists with filtering and search
- **Detail Views**: Individual entity pages with tabbed interfaces
- **Dashboard**: Summary statistics and recent activity

### API Structure
RESTful endpoints organized by resource:
- `/api/auth` - Authentication (login, logout, verify, dev tools)
- `/api/devotees` - Devotee management (protected, role-based access)
- `/api/namhattas` - Namhatta center management (protected, role-based access)
- `/api/statuses` - Devotional status management
- `/api/hierarchy` - Leadership hierarchy (protected)
- `/api/geography` - Location data (public access)
- `/api/dashboard` - Summary statistics (protected)

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Frontend makes HTTP requests to Express API
2. **API Processing**: Express routes handle requests and business logic
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM executes type-safe database queries
4. **Response**: JSON data returned to client through React Query
5. **UI Updates**: React components re-render with updated data
